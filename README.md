# 📘 Algorithms Collection

Welcome to the **Algorithms Collection** repository!  
This project aims to store and explain common computer science algorithms with simple Python implementations and documentation.  
Each algorithm is stored in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` file and executable `.py` script.

---

## 📂 Structure

Each folder contains:

- ✅ A clean Python implementation of the algorithm
- 🧠 A `README.md` file that explains how it works
- ▶️ Example usage and output
